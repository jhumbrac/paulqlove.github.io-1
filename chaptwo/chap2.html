		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
			<p>Manuel Sofia  - <em>Graphic Designer</em><a href="http://manuelsofia.me">Manuel Sofia</a></p>
				<ul>
					<p>How does this site exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</p>
						<li>The landing page immediately explains and shows what she does.</li>
						<li>I love the interactive background.</li>
						<li>The portfolio is the focal point with soft colors in the background.</li>
				</ul>	
			<p>Ello - <em>Social Network</em> <a href="https://ello.co/beta-public-profiles"> <img src="file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Web%20Development%20Courses/Projects/projectmediafiles/ello.jpg" width="200" height="200"></a></p>
				<ul>
					<p>How does this site exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</p>
						<li>I loved the charcoal grey and overuse of negative site</li>
						<li>The typefaces used are clean and light</li>
						<li>The design layout and non use of colors gives the feel of it being a blank canvas.</li>
						<li>The site does not allow too much be done on here. It seems like a place for creatives to<br>
							showcase their work, resembling an art gallery. The heavy use of negative space and<br> 
							light fonts help distract from the fact of this social network not being able to do much at all.</li>

				</ul>

		<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>They are both similar in the fact that less is more.</li>
					<li>Manuel Sofia site seems more consistent with how the typeface is used. It is a lot easier to navigate than the ello site.</li>
